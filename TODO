Make lib:
  Queue:
    - Need to remove use of sink (since it's basically useless (by design?) for practical purposes; re-work a simple play example by reviewing the code in https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/blob/master/src/sink.rs and then rework the queue to use this approach instead).
    - Test behaviour of queue skip back on first track (should do nothing)
    - Test behaviour of queue skip forward on last track (should immediately stop playing)
    - Test behaviour of queue skip back/forward with empty playlist (NOP)
    - Support pausing current track.
    - Support resuming current track.
    - Support jumping to start of current track.

  Curses frontend:
    - To be planned
